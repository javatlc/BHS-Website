<p align="justify">The 14 room mansion had a view of Little Neck Bay and the estate featured several barns and outbuildings on the property.</p>
<p align="justify">  Palvel J. Flagg, M.D. came into possession of the Cornell property some time after 1914 as records indicate Flagg's estate, which included  White Lodge, were part of a larger parcel of land that was subdivided and sold through public auction in 1925.</p>
