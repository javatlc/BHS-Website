</strong></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">The original clubhouse for the Bayside Yacht Club was a  barn taken in 1904  from the adjoining property owned by George Bradish, Jr. The barn was  expanded and the remodelled clubhouse included a large dining area, kitchen and forty &quot;bath houses&quot; complete with lockers and showers. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">After a fire destroyed part of the clubhouse in 1908, it was   refurbished  to include a billiards room and eight guest rooms to accomodate overnight visitors. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">This post card of the Bayside Yacht Club dates from 1917. </p>
