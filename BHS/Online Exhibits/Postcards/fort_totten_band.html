<p><strong>Parade Grounds<br>
</strong><strong>Fort Totten </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">  This expansive field was established after the Civil War in 1867. The Parade Grounds originally had a north-south orientation. It was only  after the major building campaign at the Fort during the early 20th Century that the field was reconfigured on an east-west axis.  </p>
<p align="justify">Today, the area is used for recreational purposes and includes an octagonal gazebo, soccer fields, a baseball diamond as well as an in-ground swimming pool that is open to the public on scheduled days. </p>
