 <p class="style1">Good Time </p>
 <p align="justify">This post card features Oakland Lake and the scenic roadway which contributed to Bayside's reputation as an idyllic, rural community. </p>
 <p align="justify">Oakland Lake suffered substantially during the mid-twentieth century due to development in the area and lack of environmental forethought to protect the fragile ecosystem of the wetlands. In 1988, after a major clean-up and revitalization effort initiated by local citizens and implemented by the Parks Department, Oakland Lake was restored to the idyllic beauty for which it was once renown.</p>
