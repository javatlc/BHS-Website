<p><strong>Bay Side Park Home </strong></p>
<p align="justify">With the advent of the Long Island Rail Road establishing electric rail service to Penn Station in 1908, Bayside became a prosperous commuter suburb within easy access of Manhattan igniting massive land development and home sales.</p>
<p align="justify">Bay Side Park was one such development. Touted in advertisements as the <em>Eden of Long Island</em>, Bay Side Park was developed at the turn of the last century by the North Shore Realty Company. The area, once part of the George Bradish estate, was sub-divided into various sized lots with an array of home styles and prices that targeted the upper middle class. </p>
