<p class="style1">Garrison's Inn </p>
<p align="justify">Anthony Miller of Long Island City opened Garrison&rsquo;s in 1890. The hotel was located at the northern end of Bell Boulevard near the entrance to Fort Totten and overlooked Little Neck Bay. Like its neighbor, Crocheron House, Garrison's was a favorite resort destination for both locales and tourists.</p>
<p align="justify">  It is unclear whether the hotel was named after the Garrison at Fort Totten or referenced Mathew Garretson, an early Bayside settler who purchased the land from the Dutch in 1645.</p>
<p align="justify">Following Prohibition in 1919, Garrison's was acquired by a locale boating organization, <em>The New York Canoe Club</em>, which leased the building and dock until it ceased operation in 1930.</p>
<p align="justify">This post card dates from 1908 (the same year Crocheron House burnt down).</p>
