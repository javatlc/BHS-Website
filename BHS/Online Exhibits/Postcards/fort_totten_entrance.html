<p><strong>Entrance Gates<br>
</strong><strong>Fort Totten </strong> </p>
<p align="justify">The two granite gate posts marking the entrance to Fort Totten were erected in 1889. By 1904 the wrought-iron fence was installed complimenting the posts' Romanesque Revival style. According to the Fort Totten Historic District Designation Report of 1999 &quot;the Fort at Willet's Point was accessed by a road that extended from Bell Boulevard at the southwest. Subsequently, the main entrance was placed at the west end of Totten Avenue, a continuation of Willets Point Boulevard, after the fort was enlarged with the purchase of 26 acres in 1863&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">The gateposts are topped by bronze painted spheres that are rumored to be disarmed harbor mines. </p>
