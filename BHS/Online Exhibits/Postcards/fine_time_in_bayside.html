<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The Bayside Historical Society is pleased to annouce our inaugural

online exhibition featuring early 20th Century post cards of Bayside from our archival collection.</p>
<p align="justify">Information for the 


descriptions

of the post cards were culled from various sources including, but not limited to, our archival repository, early newspaper articles, the Fort Totten Historic District Designation Report of 1999 as well as online resources including www.nyc.gov for information regarding our parks. </p>
<p align="justify">We hope you take the time to explore Bayside through these post cards and discover the many wonderful places that existed, and in several instances, still exist today.</p>
<p align="justify">Enjoy the exhibit!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
Alison McKay, Archivist </p>
