<p align="justify"><strong>Bayside Yacht Club</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The Bayside Yacht Club was founded on July 9, 1902 with the intent to promote sailing and socializing among its members. The following year the club incorportated complete with elected officers, a set of by-laws, and a roster of 70 members. </p>
<p align="justify">Throughout the years the club had encountered several setbacks including two devastingly destructive hurricanes, one murder, and two fires. The first fire was set by an arsonist in 1908. It was after the 1908 fire that the clubhouse expanded from the original barn and an addition of a billards room and eight guest rooms to accommodate overnight visitors.  It was also in 1908 that the murder of William Annis occured at the Club. Annis was a participant in an afternoon race and was shot by Peter C. Hains in what appears to have been a jealous rage. The second fire began in the club's kitchen in 1968. After that fire, a larger, Olympic-sized swimming pool was built to replace the original 1958 pool  which was used exclusively for the Club's members and guests.</p>
<p align="justify">During the 1920s the club had a membership rooster of over 230 members hailing from all parts of Queens and Long Island. It had a fleet of over 90 boats of many types including steam yachts, schooners, sloops, and rowboats. Sailing and motor races took place throughout the season and the club awarded trophies during their annual dinners. Other social events that took place included informal dances, bridge tournaments, clambakes, holiday and gala parties, wedding receptions as well as &quot;smokers&quot; which were given once a month for men only. The women's activities committee included hosting annual luncheons and fashion shows.</p>
<p align="justify">By the 1930s Robert Moses and the City of New York began construction of the Cross Island Parkway and all property owners, including the Bayside Yacht Club, lost direct access to the beach and their private pier including riparian rights. The City did, however, build a bridge over the parkway at 28th Avenue to a new pier and launching facility which the Club had to share with the public.</p>
<p align="justify">With low membership and a high operating budget, the Club began to fail in recent decades and the by-laws were amended in an attempt to restructure the finances. By April 1993 the Bayside Yacht Club filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and efforts by the <em>Ad-Hoc Committee to Save the Bayside Yacht Club</em> to draft a satisfactory reorganization failed. </p>
<p align="justify">The Bayside Yacht Club was eventually sold to the Grace Presbyterian Korean Church in 1994 for 1.45 million dollars. </p>
