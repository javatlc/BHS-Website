<p align="justify">The public library in Bayside was located on the south side of Elsie Place near the volunteer fire house. The present site is  41st Avenue and 214th Place. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1916  the U.S. Postal Service established an office in the building directly next to the library. As the building is not present in this image, this post card pre-dates 1916. </p>
