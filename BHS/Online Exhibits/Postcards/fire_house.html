By 1902 a Certificate of Incorporatin was issued to the Bayside Fire Company and the two organizations consolidted into the Bayside Fire Department. In order to accomodate their growing organization,  this fire house was built in 1912-1913 and dedicated on Fireman's Day, September 1, 1913. It was located near the public library on Elsie Place (41st Avenue) and First Street (214th Place). </p>
