Fort Totten</span></strong> </p>
<p align="justify">This Colonial Revival style building,  overlooking the Parade Grounds, was a single family home which served as the Commanding Officer's Quarters  until 1995. Constructed in 1909, it is a T-Shaped, 2 1/2 story brick building featuing a slate roof and gabled portico with Tuscan columns that support a massive entablature and pediment. </p>
<p align="justify">In 1926 an enclosed porch was constructed on the east side of the facade after a fire severely damaged the interior of the home.</p>
<p align="justify"> The building to the left of the Commanding Officer's Quarters  was a twin dwelling Captain's Quarters built in 1906. </p>
<p align="justify">Both buildings, along with many others, can be seen  in historic Fort Totten Park today. </p>
